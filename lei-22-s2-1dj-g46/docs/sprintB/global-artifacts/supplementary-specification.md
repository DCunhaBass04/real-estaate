# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

The website must allow the not-yet-registered user to register, and an already registered user to change account.

Information must be stored in the system in an organized and optimized way.

Passwords cannot be accessed to any other user, not even the client or agent.


## Usability 


The system must now allow the user to leave any necessary information (first and last name, email and password) blank, warning them to what they didn't fill.


## Reliability
Fault tolerance: The system can be run after an error but does not have any  built-in fault tolerance mechanisms to minimize the impact of errors.

Recoverability: If the program got any fatal error it cannot recover from his own and must be rerun to be functional again.

Availability: The software can be run anytime by the user with no effect on the performance .

Accuracy: The application can provide exact outputs over and over without any aftermath.

Maintainability: The software can be updated and reused because of his build up strategy following the software engineering principles.




## Performance

The software bootstrap time is between 542 and 658 ms.

To print properties it takes 17/18 ms.

Register an employee after adding the respective data takes 5 ms.




## Supportability 
Testability: The application is easy to test thanks to our IDE which has a debug feature.
 
Adaptability:The application can only be used in PC or laptop.

Maintainability: The program can always be updated and we can re-use the code as we want.

Compatibility: The application is not compatible with other applications.

Configurability: The software is easy to configure the user just needs to register and its ready to use software.

Installability: The software just have to be installed by the client on his PC or laptop

Scalability: The program has an interface that will help the user  maneuver and keep his things organized.
