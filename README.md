# real-estate
Project developed in a curricular context in order to meet the needed requisites (February 2023 - June 2023). Further explanations are contained in the main README file.

This project is about managing a real estate company. Here you can manage and sell properties and orders. You can also forecast sell values using linear and multilinear regression algorithms (Deprecated dependencies used).

Each functionality has its own documentation (see [docs](./lei-22-s2-1dj-g46/docs/Readme.md)).

The UI is done in console and in JavaFX.
